# PlanetSmasher

These are subroutines and functions designed to be added to the existing smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code, StarSmasher at:
https://jalombar.github.io/starsmasher/

These additions are made for an older version of StarSmasher and will be updated soon for the current version. Eventually these files will be fully integrated into the StarSmasher code.
